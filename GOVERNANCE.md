# Project governance

This document lays out the guidelines under which the AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) project will be governed.
The goal is to make sure that the roles and responsibilities are well defined and clarify on how decisions are made.

## Communication

The primary mechanism for communication will be via the `#provider-aws` channel on the Kubernetes Slack community.
All features and bug fixes will be tracked as issues in GitHub. All decisions will be documented in GitHub issues.

In the future, we may consider using a public mailing list, which can be better archived.

## Roadmap Planning

Maintainers will share roadmap and release versions as milestones in GitHub.

## Release Management

The Advisory Board will propose a release management proposal via a GitHub issue and resolve it there.

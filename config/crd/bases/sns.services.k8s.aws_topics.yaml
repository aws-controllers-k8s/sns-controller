                  A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

                  The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request
                  parameters that the Subscribe action uses:

                     * DeliveryPolicy – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries failed
                     deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.

                     * FilterPolicy – The simple JSON object that lets your subscriber receive
                     only a subset of messages, rather than receiving every message published
                     to the topic.

                     * FilterPolicyScope – This attribute lets you choose the filtering scope
                     by using one of the following string value types: MessageAttributes (default)
                     – The filter is applied on the message attributes. MessageBody – The
                     filter is applied on the message body.

                     * RawMessageDelivery – When set to true, enables raw message delivery
                     to Amazon SQS or HTTP/S endpoints. This eliminates the need for the endpoints
                     to process JSON formatting, which is otherwise created for Amazon SNS
                     metadata.

                     * RedrivePolicy – When specified, sends undeliverable messages to the
                     specified Amazon SQS dead-letter queue. Messages that can't be delivered
                     due to client errors (for example, when the subscribed endpoint is unreachable)
                     or server errors (for example, when the service that powers the subscribed
                     endpoint becomes unavailable) are held in the dead-letter queue for further
                     analysis or reprocessing.

                  subscriptions:

                     as a trusted entity Specifying a valid ARN for this attribute is required

                     to replay messages stored in the specified Amazon SNS topic.

                     * ReplayStatus – Retrieves the status of the subscription message replay,
                     which can be one of the following: Completed – The replay has successfully
                     redelivered all messages, and is now delivering newly published messages.
                     If an ending point was specified in the ReplayPolicy then the subscription
                     will no longer receive newly published messages. In progress – The replay

                  A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

                  The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request
                  parameters that the Subscribe action uses:

                     * DeliveryPolicy – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries failed
                     deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.

                     * FilterPolicy – The simple JSON object that lets your subscriber receive
                     only a subset of messages, rather than receiving every message published
                     to the topic.

                     * FilterPolicyScope – This attribute lets you choose the filtering scope
                     by using one of the following string value types: MessageAttributes (default)
                     – The filter is applied on the message attributes. MessageBody – The
                     filter is applied on the message body.

                     * RawMessageDelivery – When set to true, enables raw message delivery
                     to Amazon SQS or HTTP/S endpoints. This eliminates the need for the endpoints
                     to process JSON formatting, which is otherwise created for Amazon SNS
                     metadata.

                     * RedrivePolicy – When specified, sends undeliverable messages to the
                     specified Amazon SQS dead-letter queue. Messages that can't be delivered
                     due to client errors (for example, when the subscribed endpoint is unreachable)
                     or server errors (for example, when the service that powers the subscribed
                     endpoint becomes unavailable) are held in the dead-letter queue for further
                     analysis or reprocessing.

                  The following attribute applies only to Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream
                  subscriptions:

                     * SubscriptionRoleArn – The ARN of the IAM role that has the following:
                     Permission to write to the Firehose delivery stream Amazon SNS listed
                     as a trusted entity Specifying a valid ARN for this attribute is required
                     for Firehose delivery stream subscriptions. For more information, see

                     * ReplayPolicy – Adds or updates an inline policy document for a subscription
                     to replay messages stored in the specified Amazon SNS topic.

                     * ReplayStatus – Retrieves the status of the subscription message replay,
                     which can be one of the following: Completed – The replay has successfully
                     redelivered all messages, and is now delivering newly published messages.
                     If an ending point was specified in the ReplayPolicy then the subscription
                     will no longer receive newly published messages. In progress – The replay
                     is currently replaying the selected messages. Failed – The replay was
                     unable to complete. Pending – The default state while the replay initiates.
